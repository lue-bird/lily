small programming language, heavily inspired by [elm](https://elm-lang.org/).
Just for experimentation.

## hello world

```still
\state_or_uninitialized : ( Uninitialized Initialized.int )
  Standard_out_write.string_flatten."Hello, world\n"
```

## echo

```still
\state_or_uninitialized : ( Uninitialized Initialized.int )
  val state
        ( Uninitialized 0
          Initialized.initialized initialized
        ).state_or_uninitialized
  io_flatten.
    [ standard_out_write.string_flatten.[ state.int_to_string "\n" ]
      io_future_change.{ Change \line:string Io standard_out_read_line }
    ]
```

## cons-list map

```still
typ cons_list \element ( Empty Cons.{ head element tail cons_list.element })

\state_or_uninitialized : ( Uninitialized Initialized.int )
  let state
        ( Uninitialized 0
          Initialized.initialized initialized
        ).state_or_uninitialized
  io_flatten.
    [ standard_out_write.string_flatten.[ state.int_to_string "\n" ]
      io_future_change.{ io standard_out_read_line change \_: string add.[ state 1 ] }
    ]
```

To use, [install rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) and
```bash
cargo +nightly install --git https://github.com/lue-bird/still
```
Then point your editor to `still lsp`, see also [specific setups](#editor-setups).

## editor setups
feel free to contribute, as I only use vscodium

### vscode-like
#### pre-built
1. download https://github.com/lue-bird/still/blob/main/vscode/still-0.0.1.vsix
2. open the command bar at the top and select: `>Extensions: Install from VSIX`
#### build from source
1. clone this repo
2. open `vscode/`
3. run `npm run package` to create the `.vsix`
4. open the command bar at the top and select: `>Extensions: Install from VSIX`
#### server only
There is no built-in language server bridge as far as I know but you can install an extension like [vscode-generic-lsp-proxy](https://github.com/mjmorales/vscode-generic-lsp-proxy) that will work for any language server.
Then add a `.vscode/lsp-proxy.json` like
```json
[
  {
    "languageId": "still",
    "command": "still",
    "fileExtensions": [
      ".still"
    ]
  }
]
```

### helix
write to `~/.config/helix/languages.toml`:
```toml
[language-server.still]
command = "still lsp"
[[language]]
name = "still"
scope = "source.still"
injection-regex = "still"
file-types = ["still"]
indent = { tab-width = 2, unit = "  " }
language-servers = [ "still" ]
auto-format = true
```

## setup for developing
Rebuild the project with
```bash
cargo build
```
Then point your editor to the created `???/target/debug/still lsp`.

### log of failed optimizations
- switching to mimalloc, ~>25% faster (really nice) at the cost of 25% more memory consumption.
  Might be worth for some people but I'm already worried about our memory footprint!
- `declarations.shrink_to_fit();` saves around 0.6% of memory at the cost of a bit of speed
- upgrading `lto` to `"thin"` to `"fat"` both improve runtime speed by ~13% compared to the default (and reduce binary size) but increase build time by about 30% (default to thin) and 15% (thin to fat).
  As this prolongs installation and prevents people from quickly trying it, the default is kept.
  If this language server get distributed as a binary or people end up using this language server a lot, this `"thin"` might become a reasonable trade-off.

### optimizations to try
- reparse incrementally (somewhat easy to implement but somehow it's for me at least pretty much fast enough already without? More data points welcome)
- switch to `position_encoding: Some(lsp_types::PositionEncodingKind::UTF8)`. This makes source edits and parsing easier and faster at the cost of compatibility with lsp clients below version 3.17.0. Is that acceptable? (leaning towards yes).
- if memory consumptions turns out to be a problem, stop storing the source in memory
  and request full file content on each change (potentially only for dependencies).
  This adds complexity and is slower so only if necessary.
- in syntax tree, use separate range type for single-line tokens like keywords, symbols, names etc to save on memory consumption
- in syntax tree, use `Box<[]>` instead of `Vec` for common nodes like call arguments
